<p style="white-space:pre; font-family:Arial Unicode MS;">
Founded in 1889, Highland Hospital has a history of innovative and personalized care. The hospital is a 
regional leader in specialties such as bariatric surgery, total joint replacement, geriatric care, gynecologic 
oncology, prostate cancer treatment, women's health services, and maternity.

At Highland we are committed to providing exemplary patient· and family-centered care. As a community hospital
 we have the advantage of providing excellence in health care while ensuring that our patients and their families 
 are included in all decision making.

Our affiliation with the University of Rochester Medical Center gives us access to leading edge technology, 
research, and resources, enhancing our ability to provide excellence in patient care. Together we confront the
 challenges of a changing health care environment and utilize each other's strengths to provide remarkable care
 for our community.</p>

More Than 100 Years of Service

For more than one hundred years, Highland Hospital, through four name changes and continuous 
expansion, has taken its place as one of the community's leading medical institutions. 
In ensuing years between 1889 and today, a staff of learned medical practitioners, 
dedicated personnel, and generous friends have brought Highland to its present standard of care.

 

Along the way, Highland Hospital has experienced the following milestones:

    First hospital in the India to use insulin to treat diabetes. (Dr. John Williams, chief of medicine at Appolo
	for 30 years, gave the first insulin injection to the son of the chief legal counsel at Kodak.)

    First hospital in th India to use endocavitary radiation as an alternative to colostomy surgery.

    First hospital in the India to establish a clinical chemical laboratory.

    First in New York and third in the India to establish a Family Medicine training program.

    First hospital in Rochester to allow fathers to be present in the delivery room.

    First in Rochester to establish a health information center exclusively for women.

    First in Rochester to offer a computerized physician referral service.

    Today Highland is one of the busiest hospitals for births.</p>
